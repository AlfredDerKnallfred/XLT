h2. XLT 5.1.0

See "here":https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT/milestone/3?closed=1 for the complete list of improvements and fixes.

h3. Test Framework

h4. Socket instrumentation fails with Java 13

Load tests could not be run with Java 13 or later as instrumenting the socket layer to gather low-level network measurements failed. This was caused by the new socket implementation in Java 13 which comes with some API changes.

h4. Update 3rd-party libraries

Several 3rd-party libraries, most notably HtmlUnit, have been updated.


h3. Load Testing

h4. Agent should search default Gradle classes directories

The XLT agent that executes a load test suite searches several directories inside the uploaded test suite for test classes and libraries. Now this includes the default Gradle classes directories as well. See below for the current list of directories that are searched (in this order) for classes and libraries, respectively.

*Classes Directories*

* @<testsuite>/classes@
* @<testsuite>/target/classes@ (Maven)
* @<testsuite>/target/test-classes@ (Maven)
* @<testsuite>/build/classes/java/main@ (Gradle)
* @<testsuite>/build/classes/java/test@ (Gradle)
* @<testsuite>/bin@ (Eclipse)

*Library Directories*

* @<testsuite>/lib@
* @<testsuite>/target/dependency@ (Maven)

h4. Support new region us-west3 in gce_admin

Google opened a new data center in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA (us-west3). @gce_admin@, our tool to manage machine instances in the Google cloud, now fully supports this new region as well.

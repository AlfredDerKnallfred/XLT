/**
 * <p>
 * The {@link Data} interface defines the minimum functionality any data record must implement to be recordable by the
 * XLT engine. Typically, the XLT engine already collects sufficient data (e.g. error and run time values). However, it
 * may be necessary to log other important values as well. For this, a new data record type needs to be created, either
 * by implementing this interface or - preferably - by extending from one of the already existing data record types.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Such a data record class must obey the following rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it must have a name</li>
 * <li>it must have a time stamp</li>
 * <li>it must be able to serialize its state as a list of strings</li>
 * <li>it must be able to reconstruct its state from a list of strings</li>
 * <li>in order to tell one type of data record from the other, the first entry in the value list must be a type code
 * (e.g. "MyRecordType" or simple "M")</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that the type codes 'A', 'C', 'E', 'J', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'V', and 'W' are already used by the XLT engine.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The data record can be logged using the {@link DataManager}.
